Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to understand and generate human language. It is a crucial field in artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with analyzing and representing the structure of language in a form that machines can process. NLP is widely used in applications like chatbots, translation tools, and voice recognition systems. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is one of the techniques used to model language in NLP, where the goal is to predict a target word based on the context words around it. This is useful for building word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words
